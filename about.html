            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate web developer...I’m a little worried that I’ve wasted years studying web development since I just don’t think I’m that passionate about it.

                Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy coding and building websites and projects. I do get in a state of flow and can do it for hours on end.
                
                However, I find it hard to get excited about the latest news regarding web development. Articles about a new framework or a new tool I just don’t want to read.
                
                Also, once I stop coding for a week or so I find it quite difficult to get back into it. But once I sit down at the computer I’m fine.</p>
